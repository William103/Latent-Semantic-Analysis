The fundamental theorem of calculus states that the definite integral from a to
b of f(x) is equal to F(b) - F(a) where F is a function whose derivative is f.

The fundamental theorem of linear algebra, or rank-nullity theorem, states that
the sum of dimensions of the null space and range of a linear map equal the
dimensions of the domain of said map.

The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial with integer
coefficients of degree n can be factored into n linear terms over C.

The fundamental theorem of arithmatic states that every number can be written as
a unique product of prime factors.

The divergence theorem states that the integral over a closed surface of a
vector function is equal to the triple integral over the enclosed volume of the
divergence of the vector function.

Stoke's Theorem states that the integral over a closed curve of a vector
function is equal to the surface integral over an enclosed surface of the curl
of the vector function.

Green's Theorem states that the integral over a closed curve of a vector
function in two dimensions of a vector function (P(x,y), Q(x,y)) is equal to the
double integral of the area enclosed by the curve of Qx - Py.
